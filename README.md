# 🎧 IntelliVolume

**Smart volume normalizer app that auto-controls loudness based on user preferences using real-time analysis.**

## 📱 What is IntelliVolume?

**IntelliVolume** is an AI-assisted smart volume normalizer that solves the everyday problem of inconsistent loudness across media — like YouTube videos, games, streaming apps, etc.

Have you ever:
- Got blasted by a loud ad after a quiet video?
- Needed to manually change your volume for every new video, game, or music?
- Worn earbuds and suddenly got a painful audio spike?

IntelliVolume auto-detects the actual loudness (in decibels) and adjusts your device's volume **in real time** — so you're always in a comfortable listening range.

## 🛠️ How it Works (Simplified)

1. Measures decibel levels of system audio in real time
2. Compares to the user-set comfortable range (e.g. 50–65 dB)
3. If too loud/quiet, adjusts system volume dynamically and saves your ears.
4. Learns volume preferences over time per app/media type (in future versions)
